Neural Network Project
Overview
This project demonstrates building a neural network from scratch using Python. While in a production setting, youâ€™d typically use deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, understanding the internal workings of neural networks is valuable for architecting more complex models.

Features
Custom Implementation: The neural network is coded entirely in Python, without relying on external libraries.
Training and Prediction: Learn how to train the network and make accurate predictions based on a given dataset.
Getting Started
Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the Code: Explore the provided Python files (main.py and nn.pynb) to see examples of training and prediction.
Usage
Train Your Own Data: Modify the dataset and training parameters in the Python files.
Experiment: Feel free to tweak hyperparameters, add layers, or adjust activation functions to improve performance.
